# 🌊 EcoBot – Underwater Plastic Waste Detection

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)  
EcoBot is an AI-powered web application for detecting and visualizing plastic waste in underwater environments. Built with **YOLOv8**, it enables real-time analysis of underwater images and helps raise awareness about ocean pollution. 🌱

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload underwater images via the web interface.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are resized and normalized.
3. **Detection**: YOLOv8 model detects plastic objects and classifies them (e.g., bottles, bags).
4. **Visualization**: Detected objects are highlighted and their coordinates mapped globally.
5. **Download Option**: Users can download annotated images or view results on the global map.
